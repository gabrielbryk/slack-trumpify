### Step 1: Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trump-talk-bot
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click "Create New App"
2. Choose "From scratch" and provide a name and workspace
3. Under "Basic Information", note your Signing Secret
4. Under "OAuth & Permissions", add the following Bot Token Scopes:
   - `commands` - For slash commands
   - `chat:write` - For posting messages
   - `chat:write.customize` - For customizing messages
   - `app_mentions:read` - For future mention functionality
5. Install the app to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token

### Step 3: Create a Slash Command

1. In your Slack app settings, go to "Slash Commands"
2. Click "Create New Command"
3. Set Command to `/trumpify`
4. Set Request URL to `https://your-domain.com/slack/commands` (you'll set this up in step 5)
5. Add a description and usage hint
6. Save the command

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```
# Slack Configuration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret-here

# Anthropic API Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

### Step 5: Deploy the Bot

You can deploy the bot to any Node.js hosting service. For development, you can use ngrok to expose your local server:

1. Build the TypeScript code:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

3. In another terminal, run ngrok:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

4. Use the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) as the base URL for your Slack commands and event subscriptions.

### Step 6: Update Slack App with Webhook URLs

1. Go back to your Slack app settings
2. Update the Request URL for your slash command to `https://your-domain.com/slack/commands`
3. Under "Event Subscriptions", enable events and set the Request URL to `https://your-domain.com/slack/events`
4. Subscribe to the `app_mention` bot event

## üìù Usage

Simply type `/trumpify` followed by your message in any Slack channel:

```
/trumpify We've increased our quarterly sales by 15%.
```

The bot will respond with something like:

```
Let me tell you, our quarterly sales are up 15%. It's tremendous, believe me. Nobody has ever seen numbers like this before. We're winning like nobody's ever won before in the history of quarterly reports. The fake news won't tell you this, but we're doing fantastic. Really fantastic.
```

## üîß Development

To run the bot in development mode with auto-reloading:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
